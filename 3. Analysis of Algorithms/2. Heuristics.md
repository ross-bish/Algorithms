# Heuristics 📚
Heuristics, are problem-solving techniques or strategies that aim to find a solution quickly, even if it's not guaranteed to be the best or optimal solution. 

They are commonly used when solving complex problems where finding an exact solution might be **_computationally expensive_** or even **_impossible_** within a reasonable amount of time.


## Using Heuristics 📝

Here's a breakdown of how you can use heuristics: 

1. **Problem-solving approach**: Heuristics provide a systematic approach to solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
   Instead of trying to solve the entire problem at once, heuristics suggest focusing on specific aspects or subproblems.

2. **Rule of thumb**: Heuristics are often based on rules of thumb or general guidelines rather than strict algorithms.
   These rules are developed based on experience, intuition, or common sense. They guide programmers in making decisions about how to proceed with a problem.

3. **Efficiency vs. optimality**: Heuristics prioritize efficiency over optimality.
   While an optimal solution guarantees the best possible outcome, it may require extensive computational resources or time to find.
   Heuristics sacrifice optimality in favour of finding a solution quickly, even if it's not the absolute best.

4. **Trade-offs**: Using heuristics involves trade-offs. While they can speed up the problem-solving process, they may not always produce the best results. Programmers need to be aware of these trade-offs and evaluate whether the benefits of using heuristics outweigh the potential drawbacks in a given situation.

5. **Iterative refinement**: Heuristic approaches often involve an iterative process of refining solutions.
   Programmers may start with a simple heuristic and gradually improve it based on feedback and experimentation until they reach a satisfactory solution.

In essence, heuristics provide a practical and efficient way for beginner programmers to tackle complex problems by guiding their problem-solving process and 
helping them navigate the vast landscape of possibilities more effectively. 

They serve as valuable tools for developing problem-solving skills and building intuition in CS.

#### 💡How do I use it in a sentence? 
> _"In order to quickly find a solution to the maze, the explorer implemented a heuristic algorithm that prioritized exploring paths likely to lead to the exit."_

> _"To efficiently solve the Traveling Salesman Problem, the programmer implemented a heuristic algorithm, such as the nearest neighbor or the insertion heuristic, to find a suboptimal but practical solution in a reasonable amount of time."_

### Task ⚔️
- Discuss this problem with your classmates.

**Nearest Neighbour Heuristic** -  _sometimes called the Greedy Algorithm._
  - Using the nearest neighbor heuristic, you could start at one city and choose to visit the nearest unvisited city first.
  - Then, from that city, you choose the nearest unvisited city, and so on, until you've visited all the cities and return to the starting point.
  - This approach doesn't guarantee the shortest overall route, but it tends to produce reasonably good solutions quickly.
