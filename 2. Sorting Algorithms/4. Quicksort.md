# Quicksort 📚 

Quicksort was developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959.

As its name suggests, **Quicksort**, is a very efficient sorting algorithm _(considered to be the fastest general purpose sorting algorithm)._ 

Quicksort belongs to a special class of algorithms called _divide-and-conquer_ algorithms and owes much of its efficiency to divide-and-conquer as a general problem solving technique. 

- We have already seen how _**binary search**_ uses the divide-and-conquer technique to search for some arbitrary value in a list of keys.)
- _**Merge sort**_ is another popular example of a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

### Quicksort on paper 📝
The general principle of _divide-and-conquer_ is to solve large problems by decomposing or breaking them down into smaller sub-problems and solving these smaller problems _recursively_, and then combining the results to form a complete solution.

The quicksort algorithm operates by dividing its list into two partitions around some special value called a ``pivot``. 

- The lists are divided so that all the elements in the _first partition_ are less than or equal to the ``pivot`` and all the elements in the _second partition_ are greater than the ``pivot``.
- By sorting the sub-lists using the exact same technique we eventually reach the point where all elements are sorted.

The illustration below depicts an unsorted list with the last element chosen as an initial pivot. 
The list is partitioned into two sub-lists 
  - a left sub-list.
  - a right-sub-list.

All the elements in the left sub-list are less than the pivot and all the elements in the right-sub-list are greater than the pivot. 

The algorithm proceeds by sorting the two sub-lists **recursively**.

The diagram above depicts the initial pivot sorted with respect to the two sub-lists.

#### Pseudocode
The steps of the quicksort algorithm can be expressed recursively as follows:
**STEP 1.** Choose the rightmost element in the list as the pivot 
**STEP 2.** Create three empty lists called left_list, middle_list and right_list 
**STEP 3.** for each element (key) in the list  if element is < pivot add it to left_list  if element is == pivot add it to middle_list  if element is > pivot add it to right_list 
**STEP 4.** The result is a list made up by applying steps 1-3 to left_list, followed by the elements in middle_list, followed by applying steps 1-3 to right_list

Each list is partitioned until it contains just one element. These steps are illustrated in the graphic below starting with an unsorted list [88, 46, 25, 11, 18, 12, 22] with 22 as the pivot.
