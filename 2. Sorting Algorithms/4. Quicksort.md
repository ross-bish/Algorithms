# Quicksort 📚 

Quicksort was developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959.

As its name suggests, **Quicksort**, is a very efficient sorting algorithm _(considered to be the fastest general purpose sorting algorithm)._ 

Quicksort belongs to a special class of algorithms called _divide-and-conquer_ algorithms and owes much of its efficiency to divide-and-conquer as a general problem solving technique. 

- We have already seen how _**binary search**_ uses the divide-and-conquer technique to search for some arbitrary value in a list of keys.
- _**Merge sort**_ is another popular example of a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

### Quicksort on paper 📝
The general principle of _divide-and-conquer_ is to solve large problems by decomposing or breaking them down into smaller sub-problems and solving these smaller problems _recursively_, and then combining the results to form a complete solution.

The quicksort algorithm operates by dividing its list into two partitions around some special value called a ``pivot``.

- The lists are divided so that all the elements in the _first partition_ are less than or equal to the ``pivot`` and all the elements in the _second partition_ are greater than the ``pivot``.
- By sorting the sub-lists using the exact same technique we eventually reach the point where all elements are sorted.

The illustration below depicts an unsorted list with the last element chosen as an initial pivot. 
The list is partitioned into two sub-lists 
  - a left sub-list.
  - a right-sub-list.

All the elements in the left sub-list are less than the pivot and all the elements in the right-sub-list are greater than the pivot. 

The algorithm proceeds by sorting the two sub-lists **recursively**.

The diagram above depicts the initial pivot sorted with respect to the two sub-lists.

### Pseudocode:
The steps of the quicksort algorithm can be expressed recursively as follows:

**STEP 1.** Choose the rightmost element in the list as the ``pivot``

**STEP 2.** Create three empty lists called ``left_list``, ``middle_list`` and ``right_list``.

**STEP 3.** for each ``element`` (key) in the list
  - if ``element`` is ``< pivot`` add it to ``left_list``
  - if ``element`` is ``== pivot`` add it to ``middle_list``
  - if ``element`` is ``> pivot`` add it to ``right_list``
 
**STEP 4.** The result is a list made up by applying steps 1-3 to ``left_list``, followed by the elements in ``middle_list``, followed by applying steps 1-3 to ``right_list``.


Each list is partitioned until it contains just one element. 

These steps are illustrated in the graphic below starting with an unsorted list ``[88, 46, 25, 11, 18, 12, 22]`` with ``22`` as the ``pivot``.

### Worked Example 👨🏽‍💻📝
Type up the sample code below into Thonny and see if you can figure out what's going on.

````python
# -------------------
# Quicksort Algorithm
# -------------------

def quick_sort(L):
    left_list = []
    middle_list = []
    right_list = []
    
    # Base case
    if len(L) <= 1:
        return (L)
    
    # Set pivot to the last element in the list
    pivot = L[-1]
    
    # Iterate through all elements in L
    for key in L:
        if key < pivot:
            left_list.append(key)
        elif key == pivot:
            middle_list.append(key)
        else:
            right_list.append(key)
    
    # Repeat Quicksort on sub-lists and then combine results (Recursive call)
    return quick_sort(left_list) + middle_list + quick_sort(right_list)


# Main body of program
L = [88, 46, 25, 11, 18, 12, 22]

print("Input (initial list): ", L)
print("Output (sorted list): ", quick_sort(L))
````

### Explanation 🤓
Let's break down the provided Quicksort solution step by step:

1. **Function Definition** `def quick_sort(L):`
   - This line defines a function named `quick_sort` that takes one parameter, `L`, which is the list to be sorted.

2. **Base Case** `if len(L) <= 1:`
   - If the length of the input list `L` is `1` or less, it means the list is already sorted _(or empty)_, so the function returns the list itself.

3. **Initialize Lists** `left_list = [], middle_list = [], right_list = []`:
   - Three empty lists `left_list`, `middle_list`, and `right_list` are initialized to store elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot, respectively.

4. **Set Pivot** `pivot = L[-1]`
   - The pivot is set to be the last element of the list `L[-1]`.

5. **Partitioning**:
   - The function iterates through all elements in the input list `L`.
   - Each element is compared with the pivot:
     - If the element is `<` than the pivot, it is appended to `left_list`.
     - If the element is `==` to the pivot, it is appended to `middle_list`.
     - If the element is `>` than the pivot, it is appended to `right_list`.

6. **Recursion**:
   - The function recursively calls itself on the sublists `left_list` and `right_list`.
   - This process continues until the base case is reached for each sublist.

7. **Combine Sorted Sublists**:
   - The function returns the concatenation of the sorted `left_list`, `middle_list`, and `right_list`.

### 💡Note:
- Quicksort partitions the list into _three sublists_ based on whether elements are _less than_, _equal to_, or _greater than_ the pivot.
- It then _**recursively**_ sorts the sublists and combines the results to produce the final sorted list.
- The time complexity of Quicksort is `𝑂(𝑛 𝑙𝑜𝑔2𝑛)` for best case and `𝑂(𝑛²)` for worst case.
- This is not the most efficient implementation of the quicksort algorithm.
  - _In fact, it is quite an inefficient version. However it is used to convey the operations used to carry out the function._
- The efficiency could be improved by reducing the number of lists to 2, and simply returning the `pivot` value, or you could use in-place memory, _(by exchanging elements either side of the pivot that are found to be out of order relative to the pivot.)_
