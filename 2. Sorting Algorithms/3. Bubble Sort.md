# Bubble Sort 📚 
The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly comparing _**adjacent**_ elements and swapping them if they are out of order. 

The effect is that on each pass of the bubble sort, the largest unsorted item **‘bubbles’** towards the end of the list into its sorted position.

The algorithm is summarised below for an ascending order sort:
1. Initialise an unsorted list.
2. Traverse across every element in the list.
3. Compare all adjacent elements starting from the beginning.
4. If the elements are out of order, then swap them.

### Example 📝
Let’s look at how the bubble sort algorithm sorts the list of numbers shown here into ascending order.

Notice that **5 passes over** the list were required in order to sort the **5 items**. In general, the bubble sort will take ``𝑛`` passes to sort a list of ``𝑛`` items.

We now examine what happens in pass 1 in greater detail. 

The following illustrations depict the exchanges that take place in _pass 1_, and in particular, explain how ``7`` bubbles to the end of the list.

### Example 1 - Bubble Sort in Python 👨🏽‍💻

````python
# --------------
# Bubble Sort
# --------------

def bubble_sort(myList):
    # Traverse through all elements in the list
    for i in range(len(myList)):
        # Traverse through all elements except the last one
        for j in range(len(myList)-1):
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if myList[j] > myList[j+1]:
                # Swap the elements
                myList[j], myList[j+1] = myList[j+1], myList[j]

# Example usage:
numbers = [5, 7, 3, 6, 2]
bubble_sort(numbers)
print("Sorted array:", numbers)
````
