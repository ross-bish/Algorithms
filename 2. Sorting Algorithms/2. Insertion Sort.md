# Insertion Sort 📚

Insertion sort is a basic sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. 

It iterates over the input list, removing one element per iteration and inserting it into the correct position in the **sorted** part of the list.

Here's how insertion sort works:

1. **Start:** Begin with the second element of the list (assuming the first element is already sorted).
2. **Insertion:** Iterate over the unsorted part of the list, removing one element per iteration and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part of the list.
3. **Repeat:** Repeat step 2 until the entire list is sorted.


### Example 1 - Insertion Sort in Python 👨🏽‍💻

```python

# --------------
# Insertion Sort
# --------------

def insertion_sort(myList):
    for i in range(1, len(myList)):
        temp = myList[i]  # Store the element being considered in a variable called temp.
        j = i - 1  # Keep track of the value that we're comparing to the left of i

        # Move elements of list, that are greater than temp, one position to the right
        while j >= 0 and myList[j] > temp:
            myList[j + 1] = myList[j]
            j -= 1
        
        # Insert value stored in temp into the correct position
        myList[j + 1] = temp

# Example usage:
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
insertion_sort(numbers)
print("Sorted list:", numbers)

```

This will output the sorted array `[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]`.

### Explanation:
Let's break down the insertion sort algorithm step by step:

1. **For Loop**: 
   - We start by iterating over the list `myList` starting from the second element (`i` starts from 1) and going up to the last element. This loop allows us to consider each element one by one.

2. **Current Element Assignment**:
   - Inside the loop, we store the current element being considered in a variable `temp`. This element will be compared and inserted into its correct position in the sorted part of the list.

3. **Backward Comparison Loop**:
   - We initialize a variable `j` to `i - 1`, which points to the element just before the current element being considered (`temp`).
   - We enter a while loop that continues until `j` is greater than or equal to `0` (ensuring we don't go out of bounds) and the element at position `j` is greater than `temp`.
   - Inside the while loop, we shift elements to the right (`myList[j + 1] = myList[j]`) to make space for the value stored in `temp`.
   - We decrement `j` by `1` to move backward through the sorted portion of the list.

4. **Insertion of Current Element**:
   - Once the while loop exits, we have found the correct position for `temp` in the sorted part of the list.
   - We insert `temp` into its correct position by assigning it to `myList[j + 1]`.

5. **Repeat**:
   - We repeat steps 2-4 for each element in the list, gradually building the sorted array one element at a time.


### 💡Note:
- In insertion sort, we start with the second element of the list `myList[1]` and compare it with the elements to its left `myList[0]`. We then insert the current element `myList[i]` into its correct position among the sorted elements to its _**left.**_
- We repeat this process for each element in the list, gradually building the sorted array one element at a time.
- The time complexity of insertion sort is _**quadratic**_ ``O(n²)`` in the worst case, making it suitable for small lists or partially sorted lists.

### Example 2 - Insertion Sort on paper 📝
Starting with ``the_list`` comprising of ``[5, 7, 3, 6, 2]`` the table below highlights the **comparisons** and **exchanges** that take place on each pass of the insertion sort algorithm.

From the table above we can see:
- The total number of passes is four.
- The total number of comparison operations is eight.
- The total number of exchanges is seven.
